Simple Xiso Drive is a lightweight utility that allows you to mount original Xbox ISO files (`.iso`, `.xiso`, `.cso`), Xbox ISO CHD files (`.chd`) and ZArchive (`.zar`) files as read-only virtual drives or directory mount points. Built on Dokan for Windows and FUSE 3 for Linux and macOS, it provides high-performance, read-only access to Xbox Disc Video File System (XDVDFS) contents directly from your file manager.

The application is designed for extreme memory efficiency and supports **Windows x64/ARM64**, **Linux x64/ARM64** and **macOS x64/ARM64**.

## Features

*   **Cross-Platform:** Native executables for `win-x64`, `win-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-x64` and `osx-arm64`.
*   **Broad Format Support:** Handles standard Xbox ISO dumps (Sector 32), rebuilt "XISO" formats (Sector 0), Dual-Layer/Hybrid discs (Game Partition offsets), and CISO-compressed images (`.cso`, including split `.1.cso` part sets).
*   **Xbox ISO CHD Support:** Mounts Xbox ISO images stored as CHD (`.chd`) — any CHD format version and codec (zlib, lzma, huffman, flac, zstd) — with on-demand hunk decompression via the CHDSharp library. CD and GD-ROM CHDs are rejected; the decompressed image must contain an XDVDFS filesystem.
*   **ZArchive Support:** Mounts `.zar` archives directly — either the archived game tree or a single embedded XISO image — with on-demand zstd decompression (no extraction or temp files).
*   **Virtual `image.iso`:** The `--image-iso` option also exposes the raw Xbox image as `image.iso` at the mount root, for emulators that only accept a disc image (such as xemu). CISO and CHD images are decompressed on demand; a ZArchive directory tree is synthesized into an XISO in memory with XISOSharp's layout primitives — nothing is extracted to disk.
*   **Zero-Config Mounting:** On Windows, drag-and-drop an ISO/XISO/CISO, CHD or ZAR onto the executable to automatically mount it to the first available drive letter (M: through R:).
*   **Flexible Mount Points:** Mount ISOs as Windows drive letters (e.g., `Z:`) or NTFS folders, and as any directory on Linux and macOS.
*   **Automated Bug Reporting:** Includes a built-in telemetry system that securely reports filesystem crashes to the developer via the PureLogic Code API.
*   **Update Checker:** Automatically checks for newer versions on GitHub to ensure you have the latest compatibility fixes.
*   **Read-Only Safety:** Ensures the source ISO or ZAR remains unmodified.

## Install dependencies

The release bundles are **framework-dependent single-file executables**, so the .NET runtime and the
mount driver for your platform must be installed before the app can run.

### 1. Install the .NET 10.0 Runtime (all platforms)

Download and install the **.NET 10.0 Runtime** (the base runtime; the Desktop Runtime is not required):

*   <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0>

Verify with:

```shell
dotnet --list-runtimes
```

Look for an entry such as `Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.x.x`.

### 2. Install the mount driver

| Platform | What to install | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows** | [Dokan 2.x](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases) - run the installer, then **restart Windows** so the driver loads. | `Test-Path "$env:SystemRoot\System32\dokan2.dll"` returns `True`. |
| **Linux** | FUSE 3 - `sudo apt install libfuse3-3 fuse3` (Fedora: `sudo dnf install fuse3 fuse3-libs`; Arch: `sudo pacman -S fuse3`). | `/dev/fuse` exists (otherwise `sudo modprobe fuse`) and `fusermount3` is on `PATH`. |
| **macOS** | [macFUSE](https://macfuse.io) - allow the system extension when prompted. macOS 15.4 or later can use the FSKit backend, which needs no kernel extension. | The app starts without a "macFUSE (libfuse3) was not found" error. |

### 3. Download and extract

1. Download the archive for your OS and CPU from the [latest release](https://github.com/purelogiccode/SimpleXisoDrive/releases): `win-x64`/`win-arm64`, `linux-x64`/`linux-arm64` or `osx-x64`/`osx-arm64`.
2. Extract it to a folder of your choice (for example `C:\Tools\SimpleXisoDrive` or `~/opt/simplexisodrive`).
3. On Linux and macOS the executable bit is already set; on Windows run `SimpleXisoDrive.exe`.

See [Installation](docs/Installation.md) for the detailed, step-by-step guide.

## How to use

### Windows

#### Drag-and-drop (easiest)

1. Drag an `.iso`, `.xiso`, `.cso`, `.chd` or `.zar` file onto `SimpleXisoDrive.exe`.
2. The app picks the first free drive letter from `M:` through `R:`, mounts the image read-only and opens File Explorer.
3. **To unmount:** click the console window and press any key (or press `Ctrl+C`).

#### Command line

```shell
SimpleXisoDrive.exe <image-file> <mount-path> [options]
```

| Argument / option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<image-file>` | Path to the `.iso`, `.xiso`, `.cso`, `.chd` or `.zar` file. The extension may be omitted when the file can be resolved. |
| `<mount-path>` | Drive letter such as `Z:` or `Z:\`, or an existing empty NTFS folder. |
| `-l`, `--launch` | Open Explorer at the mount path after mounting. |
| `-d`, `--debug` | Show verbose Dokan debug output. |
| `-i`, `--image-iso` | Also expose the raw Xbox image as `image.iso` at the mount root (for emulators such as xemu). |

```shell
SimpleXisoDrive.exe "D:\Games\Halo.iso" Z:
SimpleXisoDrive.exe "D:\Games\Halo.chd" Z: --image-iso
SimpleXisoDrive.exe "D:\Games\Halo.zar" "C:\Mounts\Halo" -l
```

Press `Ctrl+C` in the console to unmount.

### Linux and macOS

```shell
SimpleXisoDrive <image-file> [mount-path] [options]
```

*   `<image-file>`: Path to the `.iso`, `.xiso`, `.cso`, `.chd` or `.zar` file.
*   `<mount-path>`: An existing empty directory. When omitted, a temporary directory is created, printed after mounting, and removed on unmount.
*   Every option listed above works the same on Linux and macOS.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/mnt/halo
SimpleXisoDrive ~/Games/Halo.iso ~/mnt/halo
SimpleXisoDrive ~/Games/Halo.chd ~/mnt/halo --image-iso
SimpleXisoDrive ~/Games/Halo.zar --launch
```

Unmount with `Ctrl+C`, `fusermount3 -u <mount-path>` (Linux) or `umount <mount-path>` (macOS).

See [Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md) and the
[Command-Line Reference](docs/Command-Line-Reference.md) for every behavior and exit code.

## Technical Details

*   **XDVDFS Parsing:** Uses the XISOSharp library to traverse the Xbox-specific binary tree structure, including rebuilt sector-0 images.
*   **CHD Parsing:** Uses the CHDSharp library to decompress CHD hunks on demand (all CHD versions V1–V5 and codecs), exposing the decompressed Xbox image to the XDVDFS parser. Only CHDs whose decompressed image is a valid Xbox ISO are mounted; differential child CHDs must be merged with their parent first.
*   **ZArchive Parsing:** Mounts the ZArchive directory tree with on-demand zstd block decompression, and detects a single embedded XISO image automatically.
*   **Mount Backends:** Dokan on Windows (`DokanNet`); a small, self-contained FUSE 3 interop layer on Linux and macOS (`libfuse3` / macFUSE), with the platform-specific structures for Linux x64/ARM64 and macOS.
*   **Shared Core:** The image parsing, virtual file system and services live in `SimpleXisoDrive.Core`; the Windows and Unix front ends only implement the mount backend and CLI.
*   **Cycle Detection:** Includes safety checks to prevent infinite loops in corrupted or malformed ISO images.
*   **Mount Sanitization:** Automatically handles mount point strings (e.g., converts `Z:\` to `Z:`) to satisfy Dokan driver requirements.
*   **Smart Permissions:** Automatically adjusts Dokan options based on Administrator privileges to ensure the highest success rate for mounting.

## Common failures and fixes

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `The Dokan runtime library (dokan2.dll) was not found` | Install [Dokan](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases) and restart Windows. |
| `Warning: The Dokan driver (dokan2.sys) was not found` | Reinstall Dokan and restart; mounting may fail until the driver loads. |
| `libfuse3 was not found` | Install FUSE 3 for your distribution (see [Install dependencies](#install-dependencies)). |
| `/dev/fuse was not found` | Load the kernel module: `sudo modprobe fuse`. |
| `fusermount3 was not found on PATH` | Install the `fuse3` tools package. |
| `macFUSE (libfuse3) was not found` | Install [macFUSE](https://macfuse.io) and allow the system extension. |
| `Image file not found at '<path>'` | Check the path and quote it if it contains spaces. A directory with exactly one image, or a missing extension, is resolved automatically. |
| `'<path>' is not a valid Xbox ISO/XISO image` | The file is a PC ISO, an encrypted Redump-style dump, incomplete, or uses an unsupported layout. Convert it to XISO first. |
| `'<path>' is not an Xbox ISO CHD` | The decompressed CHD is not an Xbox ISO (for example a CD, GD-ROM or Xbox 360 image). A differential child CHD must be merged with its parent first. |
| `'<path>' is not a valid ZArchive (.zar) file` | The archive is corrupt, is not a ZArchive, or uses an unsupported version. Re-create it from the original image. |
| `Could not find an available drive letter (M-R)` | Free one of `M:`-`R:` or pass an explicit mount path. |
| `fuse: mountpoint is not empty` | Use an empty directory as the mount path. |
| `Something's wrong with the Dokan driver` | Right-click and **Run as Administrator**, reinstall or update Dokan, then restart. |
| Write operations fail | The volume is read-only by design; copy files out to a writable location instead. |
| macOS refuses to start the downloaded binary | Remove the quarantine attribute: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine SimpleXisoDrive`. |

## FAQ

**What formats can I mount?** Xbox ISO/XISO (`.iso`, `.xiso`), CISO (`.cso`, including split `.1.cso`
sets), Xbox ISO CHD (`.chd`) and ZArchive (`.zar`, a directory tree or a single embedded XISO).

**Does it modify my image?** No. The image or archive is opened read-only and every mutating
operation is denied.

**Can I copy files from the mounted volume?** Yes, copying out to a normal writable location works
like any other read-only drive.

**Can I mount several images at once?** Yes, start one instance per image; each gets its own mount
point and console window.

**Does it support Xbox 360 or Xbox One images?** The ISO/CHD parsers are XDVDFS-only. A `.zar` tree
is exposed as-is whatever produced it, but its contents are not parsed.

**Does it need an internet connection?** No; the update check, launch statistics and crash reporting
are advisory and can be blocked (see [Privacy and Networking](docs/Privacy-and-Networking.md)).

**Do I need FUSE on Linux and macOS?** Yes. Linux needs FUSE 3 (`libfuse3` plus the `fuse3` tools);
macOS needs macFUSE. See [Install dependencies](#install-dependencies).

More answers are in the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md).
